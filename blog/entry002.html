<br />With the latest release of Glyph, I managed to exceed Github's maximum file size of 100MB. And this is only the second release. To counter this, I will have to resort to Zipception. Although this sounds complicated, it is nowhere near as complicated as <a href="http://tictactoeten.com/" target="_blank">Tic-Tac-Toe-Ception</a> or even just Inception in general.
<br />
<br />Another thing I forgot to mention in the previous blog post is that I plan on doing nightly releases of Glyph from now on. These will be unstable or buggy mid-milestone releases that have the latest features with a lot of new bugs that have yet to be fixed before the next release. For right now, I only plan on having nightly source code and Windows builds. Check the blog and Downloads page sometime in the next week or two for an update on this.
