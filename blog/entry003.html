<br />The first nightly build of Glyph Alpha 3 is on the downloads page right now as Unity source and as a Windows build. The nightly page even has its own <a href="/Glyph/download/nightly/">very lovely and newly designed page</a> of its own.
<br />
<br />And as a teaser of what I'm planning to come in Alpha 3, here are the profiles of the new bosses:

<br />It's going to be a long development cycle...
