<br />Glyph Alpha 2 has just been released, and with it come a bunch of subtle changes and slight gameplay additions.
<br />Here's the changelog:
<ul>
<li>Added energy fountains</li>
<ul><li>hover over them to speed up your recharge rate by a factor of 2.</li></ul>
<li>Changed recharge rates</li>
<ul><li>5, 15, 25, and 45 seconds from the previous bar respectively.</li></ul>
<li>Gameplay progression</li>
<li>Added music</li>
<li>Added splash text</li>
<li>Most menus are navigable with the keyboard</li>
<li>New settings menu</li>
<li>New graphics options</li>
<li>Removed startup settings screen</li>
<li>Removed FPS meter</li>
</ul>Known Bugs:
<ul>
<li>With a lot of enemies on the screen, framerates drop dramatically due to path calculations</li>
<ul><li>The issue is not render time, but CPU calculation time. With 200+ enemies, the main thread can take between 3 and 5 seconds opposed to a preferred 15-25 ms.</li></ul>
<li>Insane Mode is not a bug.</li>
</ul>Exiciting.
<br />So go ahead and download the new build from our wonderful <a href="/Glyph/download/">downloads page</a> which has recently seen a minor redesign. (Sorry to anyone who had a <a href="img/sorry.png">really small screen resolution</a>)
<br />
<br />You might also have noticed some comments above about "Insane Mode." If you have an older computer and don't want your house to burn down, I would stay very clear of that button. Here is what it looks like when the first enemies spawn:
<div class="image"><a href="img/reallysorry.png"><img src="img/reallysorry.png" width=100% /></a></div>
<br />If you do find yourself accidentally pressing that button, don't worry as the average length of a game in that mode is a little under 4 seconds. With god mode on. Also, pausing the game still spawns enemies. And they spawn every frame update. This means that in one second, about 60-100 enemies will spawn. You're welcome.
<br />
<br />I mentioned god mode before which brings me to the planned additions to Alpha 3:
<ul>
<li><del>Cheater</del> Developer console</li>
<li>More enemies</li>
<li>Enemies spawning closer to screen edges</li>
<li>Despawning enemies (to reduce cpu lag)</li>
<li>A less insane Insane Mode</li>
<li>A fourth weapon</li>
<li>In-game keybinding settings</li>
<li>Optional FPS meter</li>
<li>Score saving & high scores</li>
</ul>
