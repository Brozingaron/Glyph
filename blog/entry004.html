<br />Upon breaking GitHub several more times with large files, I've switched the downloads to go through SourceForge. Source code and the website will remain on GitHub and will still be updated. It's just that now all compiled downloads will be through SourceForge.
<br />
<br />With that being said, I'd like to give an update on all the changes made on the Nightly builds
<ul>
<li>Minor aesthetic changes (Is that a new font?)</li>
<li>Other minor aesthetic changes (Is that a new enemy sprite?)</li>
<li>Insane mode has its own song</li>
<li>Bosses! (Well, boss. The Trapezoid of Doom has arrived)</li>
<li>Removed the horrible lag spike from before by limiting the amount of enemies to 50</li>
<li>Arcade and Extreme mode have lives</li>
<li>Highscores</li>
<li>Aurum (In game currency)</li>
<li>Horribly broken map generation</li>
<li>New game mode (to host the horribly broken map generation)</li>
<li>Minor script reworks and file structure changes</li>
</ul>
<br />Very exciting. And no, the map generation is not as broken as I make it sound. It's much worse.
<br />
<br />Map generation and endless mode probably won't be in Alpha 3. They will, however, be in Beta 1.
<br />
<br />Did I mention that there won't be an Alpha 4? It's not because I'm lazy, but because we'll have moved onto the next letter of the Greek Alphabet! That and the Summer Steam Sale. How can you ignore the savings?
