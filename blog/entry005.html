<br />Happy New Year! And Merry Christmas. And Happy Hanukkah. And Happy Thanksgiving. And Happy Halloween... It's been a while.
<br />
<br />So over the last three months, I've been up to quite a few things. To keep a long story short, the holidays get complicated when you're a Senior in High School doing your Eagle Project before the end of the year and having to apply to college.
<br />
<br />And what about the other 4 months you ask? Well apparently it helps to actually release things instead of letting them sit on your external hard drive. So that's awkward.
<br />
<br />In the world of Glyph, I've decided to make some pretty big decisions. First of all, Alpha 3 is out (which I almost thought was going to break my promise and be Alpha 4), so go download that when we finish catching up with each other's lives. Secondly, I've decided to rework a lot of everything in Beta 1. When I say everything, I mean it. I'm almost starting over (which is something I kind of wanted to do anyway. There's a lot of spaghetti code). Cue concept art!

<br />
<br />Nothing is finalized yet, but expect a facelift in Glyph's future. There are many things that I reconsidered, especially trimming unnecessary elements.  This led to quite a few changes to game mechanics, including reducing active glyphs (abilities) to 2. All of the redesign is geared towards being compatible with both mouse and touch inputs and on screen sizes of 4.5" or higher.
<br />
<br />And all of this leads up to the fact that Glyph is coming to Android in Beta 1. With my brand new Moto X (<a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/motomaker?pid=FLEXR1&front-color=color-black&memory=optionMemory-32&rear-color=OP100002&accent-color=OP100026&wallpaper-file=82PA00000001&wallpaper=82PA00000049&power=OP100035" target="_blank">Link if you're curious</a>) and Unity's free Android licensing, the GitHub repository is going to be seeing a new branch come Beta 1. My fleet of devices to test is very limited (A single Moto X and friend's Galaxy S4), but expect its minimum requirements to be Android 2.3.1+, 200MB of storage, and an ARMv7 CPU. Its recommended specs will probably be somewhere in the realm of the Moto G.
<br />
<br />So that was a good talk after 7 months. I hope we'll see each other in the nightly page. I even promise to keep it active for more than 3 weeks this time.
