<br />Due to its rising complications, <a href="http://brozingaron.github.com/GiMU/" />GiMU</a> has been put on hold... Although it's sad on its own, I'm happy to announce something that is completley different and unrelated to GiMU: Glyph.
<br />
<br />This <del><a href="http://www.onemanleft.com/">Tilt to Live</a> ripoff</del> innovative game is something I've been working on in my free time over the past few months, and it's finally at its first Alpha release. Get it on the downloads page.
<br />
<br />And seriously do check out <a href="http://www.onemanleft.com/">Tilt to Live</a> over at onemanleft.com. I certainly borrowed a few ideas from them and if you've got an iOS device, they have probably one of my favorite mobile games... Ever, really.
<br />
<br />The download links for Glyph are live, and I'll be posting a tutorial in the upcoming eventually since it's a bit different.
<br />
<br />And if you're an <del>&Uuml;ber-Pro Nerd</del> Linux User, there's a bit of work to get Glyph running, but you're probably used to that by now. That detail is also on the download page over on the beautifully fresh, newly designed sidebar
