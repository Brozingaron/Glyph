<h1>Glyph</h1>
<br /><h3>By Brozingaron</h3>
<br />Glyph is an arcade-style, 2D, sprite-based game under development in Unity. Heavily inspired by a few other games in its genre, Glyph stands out with a few new mechanics it brings.
<br />
<br /><h2>How to Play</h2>
<br />Move your character around the screen using the mouse. Your abilities bar at the bottom of the screen charges over time. To activate an ability, press the number that corresponds to the ability (In the box next to its name). If enemies are near, they'll take damage and be pushed away. Push enemies into walls to kill them faster. More abilities, modes, and gameplay mechanics will be added in future releases, so keep an eye on the site (And follow us on <a href="https://plus.google.com/117912870305014001014">Google Plus</a>)
<br />
<br /><h2>System Requirements</h2>
<br />Glyph is a relatively basic game when it comes to system requirements. It's not 3D, has minimal particle effects, and all the textures are pre-rendered
<br />
<br />As a general set of recomendations, you should have:
<ul><li>Any computer made within the past 5 years with a decent graphics card</li>
<li>Any newer machine with practically any integrated graphics card</li>
<li>A 32 or 64-bit Windows or Linux machine, or an Intel-based Mac with OS X 10.5 (Leopard)</li>
<li>300MB of free disk space for Glyph to reside</li>
<li>A keyboard and mouse</li>
</ul> As a reference point, my laptop from late 2010 with a dedicated graphics card and a Core i7 (first gen) running Glyph at 1080p gets around 200FPS on average with VSync disabled (otherwise the game is capped at 60 FPS).
<br />
<br />If you don't know what that means, then you can probably run Glyph without much trouble assuming you're not using a very old computer.
